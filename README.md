# A Look At How Each State's Federal Taxation Compares To Its Representation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States, we have a system where the representation a state has in governance is determined by its population. During the 2020 election, I wondered if the amount of federal tax a state collects has an impact on its perceived importance in federal affairs. While this metric is subjective, understanding how the amount of federal tax a state collects compares to its population number and thus its representation might serve as an interesting conversation starter.
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found a wikipedia table that had the tax information I needed here: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_tax_revenue_by_state. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to use Python's BeautifulSoup package in order to scrape this data and analyze it effectively. Here I will demonstrate how to do so as well as reveal my findings of how each state's federal representation compares to their federal taxation.
