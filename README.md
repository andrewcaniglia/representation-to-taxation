# representationToTaxation

  >In the United States, we have a system where the representation a state has in governance is determined by its population. During the 2020 election, I wondered if the amount of federal tax a state collects has an impact on its perceived importance in federal affairs. While this metric is subjective, understanding how the amount of federal tax a state collects compares to its population number and thus its representation might serve as an interesting conversation starter.
  
   >I found a wikipedia table that had the tax information I needed here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_tax_revenue_by_state. I knew I had to use Python's BeautifulSoup package in order to scrape this data and analyze it effectively. Here I will demonstrate how to do so as well as reveal my findings of how a state's federal representation compares to their federal taxation.
